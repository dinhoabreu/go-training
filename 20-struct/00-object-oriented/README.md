# Go is Object Oriented

1. Encapsulation

    - State ("fields")
    - Behavior ("methods")
    - Exported / un-exported

2. Reusability

    - Inheritence ("embedded types")

3. Polymorphism

    - Interfaces

4. Overriding

    - Promotion

## Traditional OOP

### Classes

- Data structure describing a type of object
- You can then create "instances"/"objects" from the class/blue-print
- Classes hold both:

  - state / data / fields
  - behavior / methods
  - Public / private

## In Go

- You don't create classes, you create a type
- You don't instantiate, you create a value of a type
